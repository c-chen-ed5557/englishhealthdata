## data context
The Simulacrum contains data about synthetic patients, such as age and sex, and data about synthetic tumours, such as staging and pathology information.

The Simulacrum imitates data about tumours diagnosed in England in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

There is data about treatments with chemotherapy, known as Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT), which contains information about the types and number of treatments received.

The vital status of each synthetic patient up to the end of 2017 has also been simulated.


## what is the data
Simulacrum is a synthetic cancer dataset published by Public Health England. It contains data about patients (e.g. age and sex), about tumours (e.g. staging and pathology information), and about treatments with chemotherapy. It is an important dataset, as it is the first synthetic dataset made publicly available by the NHS. There is great interest in this from the research community, as the data in Simulacrum imitates some of the data held securely by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, without the danger of breaching patient confidentiality. So far there hasnâ€™t been any published research with the use of this dataset, so there an opportunity to explore it and present meaningful and interesting visualisations to the world. 


## Audience
our prime audience will be between 40 to 60 (People need to have a primary preliminary knowledge of cancer)
## Display
put the booklet in the hospital and they may have a look at it while waiting
## Problem
People often get bored with medical vocabulary and data, and hospitals don't promote knowledge in a way that is attractive or engaged.
