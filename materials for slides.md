data context
The Simulacrum contains data about synthetic patients, such as age and sex, and data about synthetic tumours, such as staging and pathology information.

The Simulacrum imitates data about tumours diagnosed in England in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

There is data about treatments with chemotherapy, known as Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT), which contains information about the types and number of treatments received.

The vital status of each synthetic patient up to the end of 2017 has also been simulated.
