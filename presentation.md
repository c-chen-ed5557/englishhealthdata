## Design:
* Who is your audience? Do you know enough about them? Would they be appealed by your solution?

Our prime audience will be between 40 to 60.

The prevalence rate is indeed higher in middle age than in other age groups
 through our data analysis .We hope to impress people with this interesting interaction.
Physiological function reaches the peak of his life when a person is 20 ~ 25 years old . After a brief period of stability, the body's organ systems gradually decline in function from about age 30(by about 1 percent per year). Therefore,  the prevalence of hypertension is gradually higher than that of young people with the increase of age. 

People often get bored with medical vocabulary and data, and hospitals don't promote knowledge in a way that is attractive or engaged.


* What is your overall take-home message? What are the findings and facts you want to present to them?

Recent years have seen a decline in the number of people diagnosed with cancer and an increase in the number of people cured
High morbidity and mortality are tumours of digestive organs.
Middle aged people should gain more awareness of cancer because 40-60 is an age interval in high incidence of cancer.
Cancer can be cured if it is found at the early stage.
People need to check out regularly.

* what do they need to know (about the data or analysis) to understand your points?

People need to have a primary preliminary knowledge of cancer.

* What is your data holders' main question? Can your solution answer it?

* How will your work be displayed to the audience?

We will put the booklet in the hospital and they may have a look at it while waiting.
We physicalised important data and messages we derived from our analysis while combining data comics and paper engineering. Audiences can get information through the interaction with our booklet.

* Why were you interested in data in the first place? This can help you finding a solution you like and clarify why the data is important (if it's important to you for some reason, it will be for others, too).

## TEAM WORK:

How realizable is your solution? Does your team has the respective skills and tools available?

Are you having clear responsibilities in the team? Do you all know what to do? can you work independently?

## FEEDBACK WE GOT:

Good motivation, and a sense of why the data analysis and presentation is relevant, along with thought about who would read it and why. Very good video documentation. The final project takes an interesting line between playful and serious. There's a tension between the interaction method and the target audience, but it may be that something quirky is actually a good way in - it would be good to see how people actually respond to this - both members of the public and the health services.
