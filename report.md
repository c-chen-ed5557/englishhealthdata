## process
Main Findings:

- The prevalence rate is indeed higher in middle age than in other age groups
through our data analysis .
- High morbidity and mortality are tumours of digestive organs.
- Recent years have seen a decline in the number of people diagnosed with cancer and an increase in the number of people cured.

According to the survey, physiological function reaches the peak of his life when a person is 20 ~ 25 years old . After a brief period of stability, the body's organ systems gradually decline in function from about age 30 (by about 1 percent per year), which means the prevalence of hypertension is gradually higher than that of young people with the increase of age (Salomon, 2008).Besides, better access to medical check ups and counselling will be useful to  the early detection , inform people about their status,and help them to get the care they need(Shephard, 2017).

From our interviews, people often get bored with medical vocabularies and data, and some of them mentioned that hospitals don't promote knowledge in a way that is attractive or engaged.

Therefore, it would be better that the prime audience is people between 40 to 60. Not only because they have high incidence of cancer ,but an educational background in understanding basic medical vocabularies.Then the method of our visualisation should include processes to consolidate information, where appropriate from a variety of sources, taking into account its sensitivity.

## Why Data Comics + Paper Engineering
Data Comics is a novel method for storytelling using sequential art, constructed from data-driven visualisations. Compared the method with slides in a qualitative study, Data Comics was found to be more engaging, efficient, and enjoyable for  participants who perceived it. And gaining great popularity, numerous people have experience and are familiar with comics, which means they have a common ground with this story-telling way. Therefore, Data Comics can also be used in visualising more "serious" statics data beyond entertainment (Zhao, Marr and Elmqvist, 2015).

Our data is about tumours and cancers, and we expect to see our target audiences perceive this serious and somewhat bloodcurdling theme in a more relaxing and enjoyable way. Besides, conveying our positive take-home messages, Data Comics can greatly reduce audiences' horror of tumours and cancers.

Traditional paper engineering such as pop up cards and books ,they use the element of surprise to delight and **amaze audiences at all age levels**. Popup books could be printed quantitatively using cheap materials and so spread quickly through Europe and the United States. Pop-up books and other forms of paper engineering continue to amaze and delight **both adults and children** (Iizuka et al., 2011). What if we combine it with data comics for data visualisation? Can it consolidate the memory of information?  And there seems to be no previous case.

Going through many works and tutorials of Paper Engineering, we found some suitable mechanisms for presenting our line graphs, pie charts and bar charts, such as pull strips, turntables, verniers. Using these interactive mechanisms, messages supposed to be conveyed can be more impressive to our audiences.
